Stormy
======

Stormy is a weather app for Android. Modified to use location services and different sources of weather data.

Stock Stormy has all the data grabbing and parsing code in the MainActivty alongside the UI. 

 - For weather source we are using thw **Forecast.io** API
 - **OkHttp** client is used for Asynchronous network calls from the API
 
 - JSON data is parsed to show **Current**, **Weekly** and **Hourly** Forecast

Currently just uses Forcast.io just like stock Stormy, but easily extendable to other APIs.
